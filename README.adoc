= PageUnit

Another web testing framework, written in Java, based on JUnit style of testing.

See http://darwinsys.com/pageunit/docs/ for (outdated) information on how to use.

To build and package for command-line use:
`mvn package assembly:single` then use `java -jar JARFILE fileName [...]'

== TODO

Simplify code.

Improve documentation.

Add a 'Head' command (maybe I for "IsItThere?") to send HEAD instead of GET.

Options: set timeout time. (maybe U for "timeoUt and other options"
